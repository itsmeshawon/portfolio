                    Over the past two years, Antwerp has built upon its well-established reputation as a bicycle-friendly city. The city’s recent bicycle plan has focused work to improve and connect the cycling network through intersection improvements, traffic light management, and an aim to lower speed limits. Antwerp’s bicycle modal share rose from 29 to 33 percent from 2014 to 2018, with a slight majority of female bicycle commuters.

                    Our persona hypothesis consisted of three different archetypes which we used to facilitate discussions about our users’ needs, desires, and varying contexts of use. Through careful analysis of our research, we identified sufficient behavioral variables to segment our user audience. These variables could be categorized into activities such as frequency of use of the scheme, skills such as riding confidence, and motivations such as reasons for cycling.

                    Alpha is a navigation tool that connects to Google maps in your mobile over Bluetooth. A simple system in Alpha gives you direction without holding up your phone. The device Alpha was inspired by a product like https://beeline.co/ who is a navigation system for your motorcycle.
