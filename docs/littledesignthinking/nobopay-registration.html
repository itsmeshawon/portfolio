            <p>NoboPay's target market is bank people and families within Dhaka and Chittagong who have multiple accounts where money management is an issue. 
              <br/><br/>
              We surveyed 20 individuals between the ages of 22-45 on their current personal finance management and prior experiences with financial apps. We found that:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>Participants' most common financial goals were fund transfer, credit card bill payment and regular purchase payment;</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>Participants who had negative experiences with registration and account verification process;</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>No convenient way of transferring funds to the bank account;</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>Difficulty to recover the PIN;</li>
              <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>Participants evaluated the trustworthiness and security of financial apps by checking online reviews and relying on recommendations from friends and family.</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>
              I also performed competitor/comparator analysis on a variety of finance apps in order to gain a better understanding of the competitive landscape.

            <h2 class="description-text-header">Defining the Visual Language</h2>
            <p>
              My role in the work process also involved building a pattern library and shaping the overall visual language of the app. I drew upon our competitor/comparator analysis as well as the Apple Human Interface Guidelines and Google Material Design Guidelines to develop a visual interface that would feel familiar, trustworthy, and highlight the most effective aspects of the client's existing brand.

            <p>Some of the design decisions made include:</p>
            <p>
              <b>Brand colors.</b> I developed NoboPays's brand colors (blue and orange). The resulting combination exhibited the brand principles of being bold, vibrant, and optimistic.
            </p>
            <p>  
              <b>Placement and color of user response buttons.</b> While multiple full-opacity buttons seemed too overwhelming, ghost buttons were sometimes difficult to identify as buttons. We used "translucent" buttons as a compromise, which would remain distinct from other CTAs. We followed the Apple HIG's recommended minimum height of 44px for touch targets.
